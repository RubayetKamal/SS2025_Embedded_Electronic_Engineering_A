Special Emphasis - Embedded Electronic Engineering A (6th Semester)

This repository contains the written coursework for the Special Emphasis module: Embedded Electronic Engineering A, chosen in the 6th semester. The course is divided into two theoretical sub-courses and a practical lab where the concepts are implemented in a group setting.

📚 Course Structure
1. Real-Time Systems:
Each student is assigned a topic to research and write a scientific paper in IEEE format.
My Topic: **Multicore Partition-Based Scheduling
**
2. Hardware-Software Co-Design:
Similar to the Real-Time Systems course, each student is required to write a paper in IEEE format on a specific topic.
My Topic: **Low Power Scheduling for High-Level Synthesis**

Each of the above topics is documented in its respective .tex file, located in the root directory. These files are auto-updated and compiled into a final PDF stored in the Compiled_PDF/ folder.

🧪 Lab Work
The theoretical knowledge from both sub-courses is applied in a lab project. The lab is carried out in teams of three and focuses on practical implementation.
